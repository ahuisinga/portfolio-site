        Hi! I&apos;m Anna, a software developer who thrives on turning complex
        puzzles into elegant, user-friendly solutions. My current playground is
        the Salesforce platform, where I design and implement everything from
        data schemas to UI components, backend services, and app
        securityâ€”basically, if it&apos;s part of our system, I&apos;ve probably
        touched it. But my favorite part of the job isn&apos;t just the code;
        it&apos;s presenting ideas to our users and sharing those
        &quot;aha!&quot; moments with the team. There&apos;s nothing like
        solving a tricky problem and celebrating that win together.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding at work, you can find me mentoring newer team
        members, especially recent graduates who are just stepping into the tech
        world. Helping others grow is just as rewarding as writing the perfect
        algorithm. I also oversee deployments and collaborate on solution
        designs to ensure our team&apos;s work is rock-solid and future-proof.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding anywhere else, you can find me reading,
        crafting, watching sports, or talking about all of the above. I earned
        both my Bachelor&apos;s and Master&apos;s degrees in Computer Science
        from the University of Alabama.{" "}
        <span className="italic">Roll Tide!</span> So as you&apos;d guess,
        I&apos;m a huge football fan, but my love for sports doesn&apos;t stop
        there. I&apos;m especially passionate about advocating for women&apos;s
        sports and leveling the playing field when it comes to media awareness.
        If there&apos;s a game on, there&apos;s a good chance I&apos;m watching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Books are another passion of mine - epic fantasy, rom-com, interesting
        memoirs - I read it all. I&apos;m always on the hunt for the next great
        read or debating theories about what&apos;s coming next in my favorite
        fictional worlds. If there is no game on or I&apos;m between books, then
        out come the craft supplies. Building physical projects is just as
        satisfying coding virtual ones. (And de-tangling yarn can be just as
        frustrating as hunting down the source of a bug.) Then it&apos;s fun to
        swap creations with friends once finished!
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether I&apos;m diving into a coding challenge, mentoring a colleague,
        or cheering on my favorite team, I bring energy, curiosity, and a sense
        of fun to everything I do.
