        Hi! I&apos;m Anna — a software developer who thrives on turning complex
        puzzles into elegant, user-friendly solutions. These days, my playground
        is the Salesforce platform, where I design and implement everything from
        data schemas and UI components to backend services and app security. If
        it&apos;s part of our system, there&apos;s a good chance I&apos;ve
        worked on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But my favorite part of the job isn&apos;t just the code — it&apos;s the
        people. I love showing off new features to stakeholders, brainstorming
        with teammates, and celebrating those &ldquo;aha!&rdquo; moments
        together. There&apos;s no fun in writing code if you don&apos;t get to
        share it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of feature-building, I mentor newer team members, especially
        recent grads just getting started in tech. I was lucky to have a great
        mentor early in my career, and now I try to pay that forward whenever I
        can. I also oversee deployments and collaborate on solution designs that
        help our team stay scalable and efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding at work (or tinkering on side projects),
        I&apos;m reading, crafting, watching sports, or talking about all of the
        above. I earned both my Bachelor&apos;s and Master&apos;s degrees in
        Computer Science from the University of Alabama —{" "}
        <span className="italic">Roll Tide!</span> As you&apos;d guess, I&apos;m
        a big football fan, but my love for sports goes beyond the gridiron.
        I&apos;m especially passionate about advocating for women&apos;s sports
        and leveling the playing field when it comes to media attention. If
        there&apos;s a game on, I&apos;m probably hosting a watch party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Books are another love — epic fantasy, rom-coms, offbeat memoirs — I
        read it all. I&apos;m always chasing the next great read or swapping
        theories about my favorite fictional worlds. And when I need a break
        from books and screens, I reach for my craft supplies. It&apos;s
        satisfying to build something tangible after a day of 1s and 0s — at
        least until the yarn ends up in knots. (Debugging, meet detangling.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether I&apos;m diving into a coding challenge, mentoring a teammate,
        or cheering from the couch, I bring energy, curiosity, and a
        collaborative spirit to everything I do.
