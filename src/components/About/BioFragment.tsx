        Hi! I&apos;m Anna, a software developer with a knack for crafting
        innovative solutions and tackling the nittiest and grittiest of
        challenges. With over three years of experience under my belt, I am
        currently part of a dynamic team at the forefront of harnessing the
        power of the Salesforce platform to deliver seamless data solutions to
        our users. My role involves managing our data schema, ensuring a clean
        and intuitive UI, designing efficient backend data processes, and
        constantly proposing innovative ideas to enhance our users&apos; access
        to client information.

        I earned both my Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Computer
        Science from the University of Alabama. Staying for my Master&apos;s was
        an easy decision â€” not only for the incredible learning opportunities
        but also because of the multiple football national championships.

        One of my greatest strengths is my love for learning. Whether it&apos;s
        picking up new skills or tackling complex challenges, I thrive on
        pushing my boundaries and discovering new solutions. I don&apos;t like
        to be bored, which is why in my free time I love to create mini personal
        websites. This hobby allows me to play with different frameworks and
        APIs, constantly expanding my technical repertoire and staying ahead of
        the curve in the ever-evolving tech landscape. When I can&apos;t stare
        at the screen any longer, I&apos;ll turn to my current crochet or
        embroidery project to see what I can do with some strings.

        This eagerness to learn is matched only by my excitement to share my new
        knowledge. When that last piece of stubborn code falls in to place, I do
        a little dance and then run to tell someone what I discovered. As a
        people person, I relish the opportunity to discuss a wide range of
        topics, especially those I&apos;m passionate about. Ask me about Alabama
        football, Taylor Swift, women&apos;s sports, or my latest read. I&apos;m
        always up for a good conversation!
